            Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event was a sudden mass
            extinction of three-quarters of the plant and animal species on
            Earth, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago

            The asteroid impact devastated the global environment, mainly
            through a lingering impact winter which halted photosynthesis in
            plants and plankton

            Furthermore, the Deccan Traps and other volcanic eruptions, climate
            change, and sea level change may have further contributed to the
            extinction of dinosaurs.

            A wide range of species perished, the best-known being the non-avian
            dinosaurs. It also destroyed myriad other terrestrial organisms,

            This devastation that happened 66 Million Years ago provided us with

            advancement of our society. And for that, we are forever grateful.
